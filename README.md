## Requirements
This block works best with a base setup with the [Product Catalog](https://airtable.com/templates/local-business/expZvMLT9L6c4yeBX/product-catalog) template.

The base should be organized following way:
- A table for `Products` that contain all the items you are selling.
- A table `Clients`, which include a `Shipping address` column
- A table `Order line items` containing  all the details of orders.
- A table `Client orders` that contains orders made by clients, with link to `Clients` table, a lookup column to order line items and a lookup column to client's shipping address. Finally a column for the tracking number.

## Features
- Integrate with your [Shippo](https://goshippo.com/) account
- Works for free with Shippo test mode too.
- Compatible with all the couriers supported by Shippo (USPS, UPS, Fedex, DHL,...)
- Track orders that have a tracking number
- Evaluate prices before generating labels
- After generating label, tracking number is automatically added to the order
